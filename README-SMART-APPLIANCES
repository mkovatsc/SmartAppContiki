The Smart Appliances Project

This Contiki branch is the basis for a case study of "smart appliances".
When developing applications and maybe even adjusting some core or platform
files, it is a good idea to have a fixed version of Contiki because updates
from the official Contiki repository could break your running system.

So for the Smart Appliances project we will use this branch of Contiki to
develop applications, device drivers for platforms, the CoAP implementation,
etc..
